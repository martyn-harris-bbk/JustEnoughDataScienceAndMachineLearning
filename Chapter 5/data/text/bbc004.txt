Tory leadership: I took money out of deprived urban areas, says Sunak

A clip has emerged of ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying he diverted public money from "deprived urban areas".

In a video the New Statesman has obtained, the Tory leadership candidate tells an audience in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, he wanted to ensure "areas like this" got the funding they deserved.

Defending his remarks, Mr Sunak said he was arguing that towns and rural areas needed help not just "big urban areas".

Labour said the leadership race was revealing the Tories' "true colours".

The party's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: "It's scandalous that Rishi Sunak is openly boasting that he fixed the rules to funnel taxpayers' money to prosperous Tory shires."

Ms Nandy has written to Levelling Up Secretary Greg Clark asking him to "urgently investigate" the changes made by Mr Sunak to funding formulas.

In the clip - filmed on 29 July - Mr Sunak says: "I managed to start changing the funding formulas, to make sure areas like this are getting the funding they deserve.

"We inherited a bunch of formulas from Labour that shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas and that needed to be undone.

"I started the work of undoing that."
