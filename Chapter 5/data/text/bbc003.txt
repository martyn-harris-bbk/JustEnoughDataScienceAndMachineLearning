As it happened: Sunak and Truss clash over economy in TV grilling

The finalists in the Tory leadership contest, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have been taking part in a leadership special on Sky News.

Here's a round up of some of the main things they were asked about.

Liz Truss

Said forecasts of a recession from the Bank of England were “extremely worrying” but insisted her plans for the economy could “change the outcome” of events
She refused a request to apologise for a controversial proposal made earlier in the week to link public sector pay to local living costs. Truss again stated the plan would not go ahead, insisting that it had been “misrepresented” by the media
Quizzed about other political changes of direction during her career, Truss argued that she shouldn’t be held responsible for views she held when she was a teenager
Rishi Sunak

Said the Conservatives needed to "get real and fast” on the topic of the economy, following bleak forecasts from the Bank of England earlier today
He stressed that he had “bold and radical” ideas on issues including NHS reform and curbing illegal migration
Sunak again refused to concede the election race despite polls indicating a strong lead for his rival – saying he had won the backing of important Tory grandees
It also seems Sunak won the room after a majority of Sky News’s live studio audience said they would be more likely to vote for him following an old-fashioned show of hands at the end of the broadcast.
