nnil94,h07hwza,2021-06-01 16:00+00:00,1622564316,2,"Well, your statement there kind of smears together two distinct kinds of ""don't work forever"" and I think it's worth articulating them.1. Lockdowns are costly.... to household incomes, business, taxes, health, mental health etc. We all know this, first hand. People get tired of them, some people -- in countries without decent government support -- literally face starvation if they can't work. So in this sense, they don't work forever.1. But even if a country *can* keep it going and going and going, there is the problem of more contagious variants. So Vietnam basically eradicated covid within their borders, with a certain *level* of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Let's say that level brought the R-value down from 1.4 to 0.8... Even if they could keep it up for years, the rest of the world is busy incubating variants, and lo! Something gets into Vietnam that has an R of 2.2. Their usual interventions can only get it down to 1.5. Now their interventions ""don't work"".For all I know, Vietnam is suffering from both.And both kinds can be helped with more vaccines sooner.But they are different."

But seriously, in the even where this new double mutation become the new virus that infect the whole world (like no more UK, SA, indian etc) Would the manufactured should produce a new vaccine? How long would that take? Or does that mean that 1 dose isn't enough and everyone should get 2 dose ASAP?"
nnil94,h06ed9s,2021-06-01 10:00+00:00,1622542265,1,The new mutation is already covered by the current vaccines. It just means we need to vaccinate a higher percentage and be fast about it.

This was a single mutation jump on top of B.1.617.2.

np2md8,h05nc2b,2021-06-01 03:00+00:00,1622519659,2,"I'm just hoping they will begin getting more vaccinations completed so I might have a chance to get over there this year.

np2md8,h071sy0,2021-06-01 14:00+00:00,1622557049,1,"For B.1.1.7 it dropped to around 90% from 95% with Pfizer benchmark. B.1.617 is a different lineage entirely, it looks like about 88%. But now the Vietnam variant combines mutations in B.1.1.7 and B.1.617 so you can expect this will likely be lower still. B.1.617 has an immune evasion mutation known from L.2 and appears to have reduced efficacy compared to that variant.P.1 and B.1.351 are also independent lineages (so you would not expect these to be additive. B.1.351 is the worst for immune evasion but appears to not be as transmissible (it gets outcompeted by B.1.1.7) but it has only 75% effectiveness. When it can get additive is when multiple of these mutations causing particular increased transmissibility (higher viral load = more infection breakthrough) or immune evasion which just means they change the ""shape"" of spike in a way that makes at least a subset of antibodies against the original one less effective.We've had the vaccine for all of a few months, I mean B.1.1.7 was barely existing when the vaccination campaign started and is now the vast majority of infections on earth. It will keep getting worse and can only go that direction. Naturally the authorities don't like this messaging but this is just the scientific truth. There is a selective pressure for one that can get past vaccines in many countries while we still have widespread infection and travel from unvaccinated countries."

You’re making all these assertions that vaccines will be rendered ineffective and so far there’s nothing that points to that being the case especially with what we know about t-cell and b-cell immunity. Of course they’re not a magic shield, but they’re pretty damn close and have time and time again showed to protect people from severe outcomes even with variants.

np2md8,h07fvfx,2021-06-01 16:00+00:00,1622563430,1,Classy. Care to provide your citations and quote the conclusions? What is the literature all scientists are seeing except me? You probably haven't read a scientific paper in your life.
np2md8,h07gi65,2021-06-01 16:00+00:00,1622563704,3,"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104974https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1Before virtually anyone could even get v1.0 of the vaccines, we already had B.1.351 (fortunately appears less transmissible than B.1.1.7 but it probably means there is more evolutionary space for the virus to become more immune evasive on top of the higher transmissibility mutations now) which have lowered efficacy. Efficacy against B.1.617.2 is a bit lower than for B.1.1.7. Now we've got yet another one not studied yet but if further transmissible, likely to decrease effectiveness further. It can only go down - that's how natural selection works. You are the problem because you think variants are not and cannot be an issue. Each erosion of efficacy takes us to an unknown place with the vaccines and whether this entire race to vaccinate and give the population herd immunity will work and continue to work.Why the hell are things only black and white for you and you can't see the middle ground here? Me saying anything negative about how well the vaccines will continue to work = antivax to you? That is nonsense and you know it. I'm vaccinated because it's dead stupid not to. If it lowers the chance to get severe illness or lowers transmission at all, we have to do it. What I'm not going to do is assume it gives me full protection forever and do stupid shit like go maskless in grocery stores or otherwise not do simple things that further reduce transmission, especially when the virus is still as widespread as it is and we've got B.1.617.2 taking over and other new ones like the one here. I have an unvaccinated child and we still have a long way to go out of this."

Maybe I’m taking your comment out of context or too literally since you talked about the need to vaccinate everyone again. Yes, some variants reduce vaccine efficacy. Are you saying that the vaccines will be completely ineffective or that effectiveness could be reduced?"
np2md8,h07gziq,2021-06-01 16:00+00:00,1622563913,0,"“After 2 doses of either vaccine there were only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2 variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable groups.”Soooo the vaccines are still effective, which is my point."
np2md8,h07jtb3,2021-06-01 16:00+00:00,1622565124,2,"There is not ""effective"" and ""not effective"". It's a percentage. B.1.617.2 is so new that there are not even peer reviewed studies yet (this is a preprint which is about all you're gonna get so quickly). With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 93.4% (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2. For only one dose: Effectiveness was notably lower after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3) compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results for both vaccines. That's a reduction. And also a huge 95% confidence interval. How many more months do you want to keep going with this? Like I said, it can only keep going down. There is no known threshold when this starts to be a problem epidemiologically. There is also no data yet to my knowledge on transmissibility from vaccinated individuals infected with B.1.617.2, about the only data on that was from a Public Health England study from when B.1.1.7 dominated and household transmission from vaccinated vs unvaccinated index cases was down by just 48%. The Pfizer CEO said we will probably need variant boosters within a year. We need vaccination with v1.0, variant boosters ASAP, and to not throw all public health measures to the wind. I can't (and nobody can) say what the outcome will be from all of this, but there is definitely cause for concern."

The order didn't get signed until somewhat late, so Australia is further down the delivery list.I recall some Moderna has been ordered too.Also slow uptake even when vaccination became available. I was able to book in at my GP a few days after I first became eligible.  Now the wait list at my GP has increased to 2 or 3 weeks, but there are plenty of times available.The latest outbreak saw the number of vaccinations per day increase 2 or 3 fold very quickly, so I don't think supply was too constrained.

npq5f0,h06jlb9,2021-06-01 11:00+00:00,1622546558,-2,"Risk is 1 in 50,000 for dose 1 for 40 and under. Unknown for dose 2. Even if it is only an issue with dose 1 the fatality rate is 20% so that’s a risk of dying of 1 in 250,000 which I am guessing is similar to the risk of dying from Covid for a healthy 20 year old, let alone a child. If rate is similar for dose 2 then it’s even worse. The above doesn’t even factor in 3 more things: 1) supply of other vaccine and 2) the actual risk of even catching Covid in the first place and 3) the fact that efficacy is not 100% so even if you were vaccinated there is still a risk of catching and dying from Covid. There’s a good reason that it’s restricted, it’s not some political game by the world against AZ. There’s also a reason no country is using it in children and also why most countries are pivoting away, even here in the UK we bought 60m Pfizer boosters and no extra AZ. I wouldn’t be surprised if AZ doesn’t really see the light of day in the UK after this first round of vaccinations and that’s fine. Shit happens and safety signals occur but now it’s correct for countries to make the relevant adaptations in the future to protect their populations. I don’t get why people get so fuming about these points - the UK won’t burn to the ground because their vaccine has been found to be an inferior product for efficacy, safety and production efficiency."
